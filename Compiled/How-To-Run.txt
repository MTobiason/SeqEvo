**********************

SequenceEvolver (SeqEvo) is a program written to generate high-quality sequences for DNA devices.
DeviceProfiler (DevPro) is a program written to provide detailed information regarding the structures in a DNA device.

Both programs require three text files to operate:
Strands File: The design of a device is specified by an input file containing a list of strands described at the domain level. (in.strands.txt by default)
Domains File: Initial sequences for each domain are specified in a domains file. (in.domains.txt by default)
Parameters File: A third file specifies settings for the program. (se.parameters.txt or dp.parameters.txt by default) 

*******************
System Requirements
*******************

These programs require that Java be installed (version 1.6 or newer required). Java can be downloaded at https://java.com/en/download

**************
Running SeqEvo
**************

To run the SeqEvo program, open a command line in the folder containing the SeqEvo.jar file and excecute the command <java -jar SeqEvo.jar> excluding the <>.
SeqEvo will require a Parameters file, domains file, and strand file to run.

A different filepath for the parameters file name can be provided by calling the file with the option <-p> followed by the filename. 
For example the command to run SeqEvo.jar using the parameter file "newInput.txt" input file would be : <java -jar SeqEvo.jar -p "newInput.txt">
A different filepath for the domain or strand information can be specified in the parameters file.

If the program runs properly, there should be a text output to the command line, and several output files produced. 
By default, all these files begin with the phrase "se.out.", but new names or paths can be specified for them using the parameters file.

**************
Running DevPro
**************

DevPro can be run by following the same process above, except replacing "SeqEvo.jar" with "DevPro.jar" where applicable.
