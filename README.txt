***********************************
SeqEvo and DevPro Computer Programs
    version 1.8 : 2020-08-09
***********************************

These versions of SeqEvo and DevPro are provided for archival purposes and are no longer actively maintained.
Use of newer versions is recomended.

The main purpose of the DeviceProfiler (DevPro) program is to calculate the fitness of an existing set of DNA oligonucleotides (oligos).
The main purpose of the SequenceEvolver (SeqEvo) program is to generate fit sets of DNA oligos.

*******************
System Requirements
*******************

These programs require Java (https://www.java.com) to be installed. Version 8 or newer is recommended.

********************
Running the programs
********************

To run the programs, open a command line and excecute the command <java -jar *program*> excluding the <>. For example, to run the SeqEvo program, navigate to the direcotry containing SeqEvo.jar and use the command <java -jar SeqEvo.jar>.

For input, the programs require three files.

1) A "Domain Sequences" file. (DomainSequences.txt by default)
2) A "Oligo Domains" file. (OligoDomains.txt by default)
3) A parameters file. (SE-parameters.txt or DP-parameters.txt by default)

Upon completion, the programs will output one or more files. These output files can be controlled using the parameters file.
